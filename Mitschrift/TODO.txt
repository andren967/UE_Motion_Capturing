calculate 	interonset interval, interstep intervall between two steps
		->use this for speed up and slow down, then standard deviation for people to compare
		tempo curve of walking (where it increases or decreases)
		time series curve, changes in tempo
maybe analysis of pop music after 3 seconds to get the mean squared error
use first 3 seconds to calculate the wie schwer es war sich anzupassen
danach vllt möglich, einen mean squared error zu berechnen, vllt von beiden die letzen 20(??) Schritte

avarage value of interstep then standard deviation, comparing music and each participant
precision of 10ms

Cadence and Pace, interonset interval of music and steps

Diagramme zum Vergleich zwischen Musikstücken und den einzelnen Personen

from review: My personal understanding was that the z-position
value posed as a ‘marker’ for each step, then the pattern of steps in a time series was compared to
the beat of the music, and deviations were calculated – hoping I’ve understood that correctly.
respective reaction time of participants – how
long does it take for them to ‘recover’ after missing one step, and how are they trying to align again
(e.g. making more and smaller steps, chancing their pace...)
Another interesting follow-up question
is if alignment capability correlates with musical training – sense of rhythm, so to speak. People who
already play an instrument might perform better in this task than others – or not.
